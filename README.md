# MultiAgent-Simulation-Netlogo

<p>This is a project I did in the course MultiAgent.</p>
<p>The subject is in the file "Dial-A-Ride Multi-Agent Based Simulation.pdf".</p>
<p>The project is written under the Netlogo version 5.1.3. It can't be executed under the version 6.0 beacause of [the changes in the version 6.0](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/versions.html).</p>
<p>Pls run open the file "Dial-a-ride.nlogo" under Netlogo version 5.* and make sure the file "communication.nls" is under the same folder.</p>
<p>My special thanks go to  Stephen L.'s project [netlogo-mas-drones](https://github.com/lrq3000/netlogo-mas-drones):</p>
<p>The file "communication.nls" is copied from that project.</p>
